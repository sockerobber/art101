			<h1>Lab 12 - Conditionals</h1>
			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Challenge</h2>
                    <p>Working with your partner, create a function that depends on conditionals.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
                    <p>I only had a few minor problems when I was working with the javascript of the lab. I still forget how to correctly code buttons and how the listen for an event. I'm slowly understanding what they mean but I forget where and how to insert the listener. I also was having trouble with the conditional statements because I didn't put quotes in the when I wanted to return the value/string.</p>
        	</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
                    <p>Since I have python experience this lab was relatively simple in the sense that I know how to work with if/else/else-if statements, conditionals are honestly my favorite part about coding just because you can have many opertations happening in one program and it's honestly really cool to me.</p>
            </div>
