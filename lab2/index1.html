        <h1>Hello World</h1>
        
        <p>My name is Brandon Vindel. I'm a very introverted person who likes to spend time indoors. I love playing video games and seem to always lose track of time when I'm playing. I play mainly sports games but I'm pretty decent at first person shooters, platfromers, and racing games. I also enjoy listening to music and looking at art. Cooking food is very therapeutic to me and I have this little dream of becoming a chef one day maybe alongside becoming a video game designer but if not I wouldn't mind being a stay at home dad that knows how to cook amazing food lol. That being said I'm a really friendly person who can get along with anyone and always prioritizes making others happy before I can be happy.</p>
        <p>My partner’s name is Jacob, from Merrill. He’s an artist and a writer who prefers to sleep like a log whenever he’s not doing either of the two. He’d like to make a living off either of those two hobbies, so being in the AGPM major is boosting his knowledge in creating video games which he hopes to be able to utilize for his personal benefit to create and design games for himself.</p>
