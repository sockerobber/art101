			<h1>Lab 14 - Debugging Tools & Strategies</h1>

					<h2>Challenge</h2>
                    <p>With a partner, use your debugging knowledge to fix old assignments.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
                    <p>The only problems I really had were trying to find an error on my labs, I feel like since eveyrthing was already working I didn't really need to debug anything, however I did try to enhance some of the labs by experimenting on using buttons to link the results to another page.</p>
        	</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
                    <p>After completing this lab, I have to say it was quite simple just because I really only had to play around with some of the options and clean up my files to make them more readable.</p>
            </div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Results</h2>
                    <p>Below are my results for this lab!</p>
                        <div id="output">
                        </div>

        <section class="Debugging">
            <h2>Screenshots of labs being debugged</h2>
            <img class="screenshot" src="img/lab2-results.png">
            <p>I added a button to my lab 2 that holds my results in another a page so when you push the button, the site goes to another page to show the results.</p>
            <img class="screenshot" src="img/lab13-resb.png">
            <p>I thought it would be cool to see some kind of button that can hide my results and show them again upon pushing the button. I did use some help from chat gpt, but for the most part it looks really cool and I feel like my understanding for html/javascript has boosted these past few weeks.</p>
