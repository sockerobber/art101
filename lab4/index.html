			<h1>Lab 4 - Pseudocoding and Problem Solving</h1>
			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>Get in the habit of thinking in terms of pseudocoding before jumping into coding.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>This assignment was fairly straight forward, where all we really had to do was get the gist of using comments and using psuedocode which is helpful in being organzied and on top of what you have to code.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>This assignment was decent, relatively easy to say the least, but it's still useful in learning the importance of psuedocoding. </p>
			</div>

					<h3>Pseudocode: Hangman</h3>
					<pre><code>
//Pseudocode: Hangman 
//Print a tree
//Ask the user to type in a word or ask the computer to generate a word
  //If generated, ask the user to choose the number of letters in the word
//Draw a dashed line
  //Print '_' per letter in the word
//Ask the user to input a letter (guess)
  //If the letter is wrong, Draw a piece of the man being hanged from the tree
    //Starting with his head going down (head, neck, left arm, right arm)
    //Show the wrong letter to the side of the tree to keep mark of the incorrect letters
//If the letter is in the word, show the letter on top of a dashed line for everytime the letter comes out in the word
//Check for win/lose condition
  //If the word is found, the user wins 
  //If the man is hanged(ran out of lives), the user loses
//Ask user if they'd like to play again
					</code></pre>
