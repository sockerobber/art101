// Constants 

//Print a tree
//Ask the user to type in a word or ask the computer to generate a word
  //If generated, ask the user to choose the number of letters in the word
//Draw a dashed line
  //Print '_' per letter in the word
//Ask the user to input a letter (guess)
  //If the letter is wrong, Draw a piece of the man being hanged from the tree
    //Starting with his head going down (head, neck, left arm, right arm)
    //Show the wrong letter to the side of the tree to keep mark of the incorrect letters
//If the letter is in the word, show the letter on top of a dashed line for everytime the letter comes out in the word
//Check for win/lose condition
  //If the word is found, the user wins 
  //If the man is hanged(ran out of lives), the user loses
//Ask user if they'd like to play again
