					<h2>About Me</h2>
					<img id="my-portrait" src ='img/IMG_6271.png'/>
					<p>I play a lot of video games, I love playing fifa. I'd say I'm quite good at the game, recently I've been getting into shooter games more, such as Call of Duty, mainly zombies because it is just so fun. I love to look at art, I think it's really cool seeing how creative minds work and what can come out of these minds is exceptional. I'm looking forward to learning more in this class so I can maybe create a site that works with apps from your phone, I feel like that's really interesting and to be able to create one gives me the idea that I can maybe get a career in web design for greater companies.</p>
