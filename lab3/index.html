			<h1>Lab 3 - File Structure and File Transfer</h1>
			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>The whole point of this lab is to create a local file structure on my computer and add index.html files into it.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>I didn't encounter too many problems, the main ones came from style and playing with css to make my homepage have more color. Also, when I went on the public site, one of the links wasn't working to go back to the homepage but the links work to go to the labs which was confusing. I also had trouble adding in images, using the right folder call tripped me up but I eventually got it to work. </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>After completing this lab I figured out how to make my site work as an actual website and I think it's so cool to be able to do that, even if my site is simple as of now.</p>
			</div>

					<h2>Results</h2>
