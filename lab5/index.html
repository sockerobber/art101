					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>Working with your partner, experiment with basic JavaScript data types and variables.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>My biggest problem was trying to make the Script output become its own section on the lab sheet. I also faced difficulties trying to allign the image of the car at the top right of the page and making it not overlap the sections. </p>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>Upon completing the lab I liked how my knowledge of how to change certain aspects of the site is there, I know what I am doing for the most part. I wish I could make the imgage fit within a certain section of the site like inside the challenges box for example, but it looks fine where it cuts off perfectly with the next box and doesn't look like I just threw the image in. </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Results</h2>
					<p>Below is the script output about the car I drive on a semi daily basis.</p>
					<div id="output"></div>
